## About
This is an exact copy of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hJ4pOAO.png">this</a> Kayak promotional email, made using the Foundation for Emails framework. I built this email utilizing partials to emulate the likely development process employed by the actual company; the header and footer partials are built to be resuable across all company emails. The body is located in src/pages/index.html, and the parent component or "layout" is located in src/layouts/kayak.html. I put additional data in src/data/kayakEmail.json that can be referenced in index.html using handlebars to expand upon the offers displayed in the email.
